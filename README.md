# My adjusted goals for HW05:
# - Read through the Phoenix guides at https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/overview.html
# - Add two new pages to your application, both under the "pages" controller:
#   - A landing page that forces you to register or log in, with both forms on that page.
#   - A dashboard page for logged in users, showing their feed of messages. Each message should include the email or username of the user who posted it.
# - Get deployment working 100% reliabily, including js/css assets, with a deploy script.
